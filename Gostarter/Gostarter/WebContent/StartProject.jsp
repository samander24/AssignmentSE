		                		<li>Kickstarter cannot be used to sell equity or solicit loans.</li>
		                		<li>Projects cannot resell items or offer rewards not produced by the project or its creator.</li>
		                		<li>Creators cannot promise to donate a portion of funds raised or future revenue to a cause.</li>
		                		<li>Projects cannot offer rewards in bulk quantities (more than 10).</li>
		                		<li>Kickstarter cannot be used to fund e-commerce, business, and social networking websites or apps.</li>
		                		<li>Kickstarter cannot be used to fund software projects not run by the developers themselves.</li>
		                		<li>Kickstarter cannot be used to buy real estate.</li>
		                		<li>Projects cannot offer alcohol as a reward.</li>
		                		<li>Projects cannot offer genetically modified organisms as a reward. (Updated 7/31/2013)</li>
		                		<li>No self-help material (books, videos, etc). This includes projects that offer (or produce materials that offer) business, emotional, financial, health, medical, sex/seduction, or other self-help advice.</li>
		                		<li>No offensive material (hate speech, etc.); pornographic material; or projects endorsing or opposing a political candidate.</li>

		                		<li>
		                			<h3>Show your work</h3>
		                			<p>Projects must be clear about their state of development, and cannot be presented as preorders of finished products. Projects must show details (photos, videos, sketches) of their progress so far, along with a prototype demonstrating the product's current functionality. Projects must explain how the final design is likely to differ from the prototype, and include a production plan (i.e., how you're going to make it) and an estimated timeline.</p>
		                		</li>
		                		<li>
		                			<h3>No product simulations or photorealistic renderings</h3>
		                			<p>Technical drawings, CAD designs, sketches, and other parts of the design process are awesome and encouraged. Photorealistic renderings and simulations that could be mistaken for finished products or real events, however, are not allowed.</p>
		                		</li>
		                		<li>
		                			<h3>Single servings</h3>
		                			<p>Product Design and Hardware projects can only offer one reward per pledge. Offering multiple quantities can imply that rewards are shrink-wrapped and ready to ship when they’re not. With some projects, we'll make exceptions for what we consider sensible sets — things like salt and pepper shakers, notebooks, building blocks, etc.</p>

		                	<h2>About these guidelines</h2>
		                	<p>Kickstarter’s mission is to help bring creative projects to life. Since launching in April 2009, we’ve adjusted these guidelines several times — to add more of them to fit new uses, or to simplify them as we learn (and after seeing 100,000+ projects, we’ve learned a ton). The guidelines are never perfect, but we care deeply about trying to get them right. We aim to be as open as possible while protecting the health and creative spirit of Kickstarter for the long term. Thanks for reading.</p>

											<p>Don't use music, images, video, or other content that you don't have the rights to.

		                		<p>Part of every creatorโ€s job is earning their backersโ€ trust, especially backers who donโ€t personally know them. Itโ€s up to you to make the case that you can successfully bring your project to life. Present your qualifications and share links that help reinforce them.</p>
		                		
		                		<h4>Returning creators</h4>
		                		<p>Launching another project? Awesome! For the sake of transparency, just be sure all of them are under the same account. In special circumstances where this won't work (this project a solo album, the last one was with your mariachi band) just be sure to link to any previous projects in your bio.</p>
